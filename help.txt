Welcome to my Text based combat simulator

Each round you will face an assortment of 4 random enimies, once defeated, you will face the Dragon boss.
After every enemy kill you will recive a random upgrade for either your Sword, Bow, Helemet, or Body armor.
Killing the dragon boss drops double upgrades, and a HP potion that will recover 150 life.

Defeat as many enimies as you can before your health reachs Zero!

Quick attack will attack the current enemy with a 75% chance to hit, dealing the chosen weapons damage if sucessful.

Heavy attack will attack the current enemy with a 55% chance to hit, dealing 150% of the chosen weapons damage if sucessful.

Attacking the enemy with the weapon thats type corresponds with enemy weakness will deal an aditional 20% damage of the chosen weapons damage.

The Status option allows you to view your characters current name and health, weapons and armor, as well as how many eneimes you have defeated.

You are also able to view the score of the previous players run.

Good luck and have fun!
